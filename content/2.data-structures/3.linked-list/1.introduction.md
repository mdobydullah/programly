A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are linked using pointers. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, making them flexible and efficient for dynamic memory usage.

### Key Characteristics of Linked Lists

- **Dynamic Size**: Linked lists can grow or shrink by adding or removing nodes, making them ideal for scenarios where the data size is unknown.
- **Non-contiguous Storage**: Nodes are scattered in memory and connected through pointers, allowing efficient memory usage.
- **Sequential Access**: Nodes must be accessed in sequence from the head, which is the starting node of the list.

### Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node has a pointer to the next node only.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has pointers to both the previous and next nodes, enabling traversal in both directions.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, creating a circular chain.

### Advantages of Linked Lists

- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Nodes can be easily added or removed without shifting other elements.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Linked lists use memory only as needed, preventing wasted memory allocation.

### Disadvantages of Linked Lists

- **No Random Access**: Accessing an element requires sequential traversal from the head node.
- **Extra Memory for Pointers**: Each node needs additional memory for storing pointers, making it less memory-efficient than arrays for small datasets.

### Applications of Linked Lists

- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Useful in scenarios where the data structure needs to grow or shrink frequently.
- **Implementing Other Data Structures**: Forms the basis for data structures like stacks, queues, and graphs.
- **File Systems and Operating Systems**: Commonly used to manage memory blocks and file directories.

Linked lists are foundational in data structures, providing flexible and efficient solutions for dynamic data handling.
