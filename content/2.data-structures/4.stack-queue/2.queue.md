A queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. This means that the element added first will be the first one to be removed, much like a line at a checkout counter.

### Key Characteristics

* **FIFO Principle**: Elements are removed in the order they were added.
* **Two main operations**:
    * **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
    * **Dequeue**: Removes an element from the front of the queue.

### Types of Queues

* **Simple Queue**: Basic queue with FIFO order.
* **Circular Queue**: Connects the end of the queue back to the front, allowing for better utilization of memory.
* **Priority Queue**: Elements are dequeued based on priority, not just on the order they were enqueued.
* **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**: Allows insertion and deletion from both ends.

### Applications of Queue

* **Scheduling tasks**: Like printer job management.
* **Handling requests**: Web servers use queues to handle client requests in order.
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: In graph traversal and other algorithms.

### Example (in Python)

```python
from collections import deque

# Initialize a queue
queue = deque()

# Enqueue elements
queue.append("a")
queue.append("b")
queue.append("c")

# Dequeue elements
print(queue.popleft())  # Output: "a"
print(queue.popleft())  # Output: "b"

```

This implementation uses Pythonâ€™s `deque` from the `collections` module, which efficiently supports queue operations.
