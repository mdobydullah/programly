Level Up Your Skills :br with Programly

#description
The goal of Programly is to help you get a job in the shortest amount of time possible in a data-driven way. We compiled datasets of tech interview problems and broke them down by patterns. This way, we can determine the most frequently tested and highest return on investment (ROI) area to focus on. We'll look at the breakdown for top problems overall and company-specific investigations.
