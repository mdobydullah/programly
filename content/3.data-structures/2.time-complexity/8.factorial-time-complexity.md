title: Factorial Time Complexity
description: 'Factorial time complexity with example'
---

**Factorial time complexity** refers to algorithms where the number of operations grows as the **factorial** of the input size. The factorial of a number \( n \) is defined as:

```
n! = n×(n−1)×(n−2)×…×2×1
```

This type of time complexity is extremely inefficient for large inputs, as the number of operations increases **super-exponentially**. Algorithms with **O(n!)** complexity are generally impractical for inputs larger than a very small size.

### Example

**The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**

Let's consider the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** as an example of an algorithm with **O(n!)** complexity.

**Problem Statement**:  
Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

#### How the Brute Force Solution Works:

1. Suppose you have **4 cities**: A, B, C, and D.
2. The brute force approach involves trying **every possible route** to find the shortest one.
3. For **4 cities**, the possible routes are:
    - A → B → C → D → A
    - A → B → D → C → A
    - A → C → B → D → A
    - A → C → D → B → A
    - A → D → B → C → A
    - A → D → C → B → A
4. There are **4! = 24** possible routes to check.

As the number of cities increases, the number of possible routes grows **factorially**:

- For 5 cities: \( 5! = 120 \) routes
- For 6 cities: \( 6! = 720 \) routes
- For 10 cities: \( 10! = 3,628,800 \) routes

This quickly becomes impractical to solve with brute force as \( n \) increases.

### Why is TSP O(n!)?

- The brute force approach requires checking **every possible permutation** of cities to find the shortest route.
- For \( n \) cities, there are \( n! \) permutations.
- Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n!)**.

### Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you're hosting a dinner party and want to arrange **6 guests** in different seating orders. To try every possible arrangement:

1. You start with 6 options for the first seat.
2. After choosing the first seat, there are 5 options left for the second seat.
3. Then 4 options for the third seat, and so on.

The total number of seating arrangements would be:

```
6! = 6×5×4×3×2×1 = 720
```

If you had **10 guests**, the number of arrangements would jump to **3,628,800**, making it practically impossible to try every possible seating order manually.

### Optimization Tip:

For problems like TSP, where the brute force solution is **O(n!)**, more efficient algorithms like **Dynamic Programming** (e.g., the Held-Karp algorithm) or **heuristic approaches** are used to find approximate solutions in a reasonable time.
