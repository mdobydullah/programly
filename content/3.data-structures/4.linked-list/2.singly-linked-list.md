title: Singly Linked List
description: 'Singly linked list in Python'

A singly linked list in Python is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next element in the sequence. Each node consists of two parts:

* `data:` stores the actual value.
* `next:` points to the next node in the list (or None if it is the last node).

Here’s an example of using a singly linked list in Python.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        if not self.head:
            self.head = Node(data)
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = Node(data)

    def delete(self, data):
        if not self.head:
            return
        
        if self.head.data == data:  # If head needs to be deleted
            self.head = self.head.next
            return

        current = self.head
        while current.next and current.next.data != data:
            current = current.next
        
        if current.next:  # If found, delete the node
            current.next = current.next.next

    def display(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

# Usage
ll = LinkedList()
ll.append(1)
ll.append(2)
ll.append(3)
ll.display()

ll.delete(2)
ll.display()
```

### Output

```python
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None
1 -> 3 -> None
```

### Explanation

This code defines a singly linked list with three basic operations:

* Appending a Node `(append)` – Adds a new node at the end.
* Deleting a Node `(delete)` – Removes a node by its value.
* Displaying the List `(display)` – Prints the list in order.

#### 1. Node Class (Node)

Each node in the linked list contains:

* `data` → The value stored in the node.
* `next` → A pointer to the next node in the list.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

* When a `Node` object is created, its `data` is set, and `next` is `None` (meaning no next node yet).

#### 2. LinkedList Class (LinkedList)

This class manages the linked list operations.

**(a) Initializing the Linked List:**

```python
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None  # Initially, the list is empty.
```

* `self.head` stores the first node of the linked list.
* If `head` is `None`, the list is empty.

**(b) Append a Node (append)**

Adds a new node to the end of the list.

```python
def append(self, data):
    if not self.head:  # If the list is empty, set head to new node
        self.head = Node(data)
        return

    current = self.head
    while current.next:  # Traverse to the last node
        current = current.next
    current.next = Node(data)  # Attach the new node at the end
```

* If `head` is `None`, the list is empty, so we set `head = Node(data)`.
* Otherwise, we traverse (`while current.next`) until we reach the last node.
* Then, we create a new node and attach it to the last node.

**(c) Delete a Node (delete)**

Removes a node containing a specific value.

```python
def delete(self, data):
    if not self.head:  # If list is empty, do nothing
        return
    
    if self.head.data == data:  # If head is to be deleted
        self.head = self.head.next
        return

    current = self.head
    while current.next and current.next.data != data:  # Find the node before the one to delete
        current = current.next
    
    if current.next:  # If the node is found, remove it
        current.next = current.next.next
```

* If the list is empty, nothing happens.
* If the node to delete is the `head`, move `head` to the next node.
* Otherwise, we traverse to find the node before the one to be deleted.
* If found, we adjust the `next` pointer to skip the unwanted node.

**(d) Display the List (display)**

Prints all nodes in order.

```python
def display(self):
    current = self.head
    while current:
        print(current.data, end=" -> ")
        current = current.next
    print("None")
```

* Starts at `head` and prints each node’s `data`.
* Stops when `current` becomes `None`.

#### Usage Example

```python
ll = LinkedList()
ll.append(1)
ll.append(2)
ll.append(3)
ll.display()  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None

ll.delete(2)
ll.display()  # Output: 1 -> 3 -> None
```
